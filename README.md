# Deloitte_data_challenge_public

See my presentation in Deloitte Data Challenge.pdf

See how I trained the model in Full Workflow.ipynb

Evaluate a new dataset with Evaluation Workflow.ipynb

The model file itself is stored in collateral/best_fit_xgb_reg_model.json . You need to use the xgboost package to load it. I think you need to make sure you have the same version as me too.

my conda env is here too in case something is weird
